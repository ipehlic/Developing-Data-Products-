## Overview


The shiny app uses the ggplot2 diamonds dataset to plot the price of diamonds by carat. The carat range can be changed using the slider at the top of the application, and the range of the plotâ€™s x-axis would change accordingly. The app will show diamond price based on input of the following input variables: 

- Carat: weight or size of diamonds that can be from .32 carat to 4.0 carat
- Cut: quality of diamonds (Ideal, Premium, Very Good, Good, Fair)
- Clarity: measurement of how clear are diamonds (IF, VVS2, VVS1, VS2, VS1, SI2, SI1, I1)

## Documentation 

Here is a summary of the ggplot2 diamonds dataset. The factors were measured in over 50,000 diamonds. 
```{r comment = NA}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
str(diamonds[,c(1:2,4,7)])
```

## Visualization 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 # Scatter plot with smoothed means
           plot<- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price))+
            geom_point(aes(colour = cut), alpha = 1/2) +
            geom_smooth() +
            scale_size_area(max_size = 2) +
            ggtitle("Price vs. Carat")
plot
```
